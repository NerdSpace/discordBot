This is my discord bot for the nerd space guild.
You can feel free to change everything, but it would be nice when you give me some credits.

1. Go to the BotToken.java and paste your bot token
2. Go to the STATIC.java and edit it



Feel free to leave some feedback or commit a pull request.

If you need help with the code or found a bug, please contact me.
